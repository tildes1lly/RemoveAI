# RemoveAI
Remove AI results from search results on Firefox and Firefox based browsers.
This extension only supports Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo search engines. I will attempt to add any that are missing if a user requests them. <br>
<strong>To request an engine be added, or submit an exception that helps filter out AI results, submit an <a href="https://github.com/tildes1lly/RemoveAI/issues">issue</a> tagged with "feature request" </strong>

# Downloading
Simply download RemoveAI.zip from Releases, extract it, and add manifest.json as an extention to Firefox.

# How to use:
In any Google, Bing, Or DuckDuckGo search, add <code>!ai</code> to the end of your search. This will apply filters to block out ai results without you having to type them in manually. <br>
<strong>NOTE: This is best for filtering AI images. Sites that are for AI likely will be blocked, but AI generated websites will not be blocked. </strong>
